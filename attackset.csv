This resolution represents the second-largest payment to resolve a HIPAA investigation in OCR history. PBC operates in Washington and Alaska, and is the largest health plan in the Pacific Northwest, serving more than two million people.

On March 17, 2015, PBC filed a breach report on behalf of itself and its network of affiliates stating that cyber-attackers had gained unauthorized access to its information technology (IT) system.  The hackers used a phishing email to install malware that gave them access to PBC’s IT system in May 2014, which went undetected for nearly nine months until January 2015.  This undetected cyberattack, otherwise known as an advanced persistent threat, resulted in the disclosure of more than 10.4 million individuals’ protected health information including their names, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, Social Security numbers, bank account information, and health plan clinical information. 

OCR’s investigation found systemic noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules including failure to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis, and failures to implement risk management, and audit controls.

“If large health insurance entities don’t invest the time and effort to identify their security vulnerabilities, be they technical or human, hackers surely will. This case vividly demonstrates the damage that results when hackers are allowed to roam undetected in a computer system for nearly nine months,” said Roger Severino, OCR Director.  

In addition to the monetary settlement, PBC has agreed to a robust corrective action plan that includes two years of monitoring.  The resolution agreement and corrective action plan may be found at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/premera-ra-cap.pdf.

"The covered entity (CE), Carolina’s Medical Center, discovered that a physician had responded to a phishing email and provided her password to a third party, causing all of the physician’s emails to be forwarded to a third party.  The forwarded emails included protected health information (PHI) regarding 5,600 individuals.  The PHI in the emails included names, dates of birth, medications, treatment information, social security numbers (for 5 patients), dates of service, addresses, names of providers, admission/discharge dispositions and dates, and internal medical record and account numbers.  Following the breach, CE improved administrative and technical safeguards by terminating auto-forwarding capabilities and implementing an alert for remote system accesses that originate from a foreign country.

"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the lack of a security management process to safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI). Metro Community Provider Network (MCPN), a federally-qualified health center (FQHC), has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $400,000 and implementing a corrective action plan. With this settlement amount, OCR considered MCPN’s status as a FQHC when balancing the significance of the violation with MCPN’s ability to maintain sufficient financial standing to ensure the provision of ongoing patient care. MCPN provides primary medical care, dental care, pharmacies, social work, and behavioral health care services throughout the greater Denver, Colorado metropolitan area to approximately 43,000 patients per year, a large majority of whom have incomes at or below the poverty level.

On January 27, 2012, MCPN filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a hacker accessed employees' email accounts and obtained 3,200 individuals' ePHI through a phishing incident. OCR’s investigation revealed that MCPN took necessary corrective action related to the phishing incident; however, the investigation also revealed that MCPN failed to conduct a risk analysis until mid-February 2012. Prior to the breach incident, MCPN had not conducted a risk analysis to assess the risks and vulnerabilities in its ePHI environment, and, consequently, had not implemented any corresponding risk management plans to address the risks and vulnerabilities identified in a risk analysis. When MCPN finally conducted a risk analysis, that risk analysis, as well as all subsequent risk analyses, were insufficient to meet the requirements of the Security Rule.

“Patients seeking health care trust that their providers will safeguard and protect their health information,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “Compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule helps covered entities meet this important obligation to their patient communities.”

"Failure to protect the health records of millions of persons costs entity millions of dollars 21st Century Oncology, Inc. (21CO) has agreed to pay $2.3 million in lieu of potential civil money penalties to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and adopt a comprehensive corrective action plan to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules. 21CO is a provider of cancer care services and radiation oncology. With their headquarters located in Fort Myers, Florida, 21CO operates and manages 179 treatment centers, including 143 centers located in 17 states and 36 centers located in seven countries in Latin America.

On two separate occasions in 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) notified 21CO that patient information was illegally obtained by an unauthorized third party and produced 21CO patient files purchased by an FBI informant. As part of its internal investigation, 21CO determined that the attacker may have accessed 21CO’s network SQL database as early as October 3, 2015, through the remote desktop protocol from an exchange server within 21CO’s network. 21CO determined that 2,213,597 individuals were affected by the impermissible access to their names, social security numbers, physicians’ names, diagnoses, treatment, and insurance information. OCR’s subsequent investigation revealed that 21CO failed to conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic protected health information (ePHI); failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; failed to implement procedures to regularly review records of information system activity, such as audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports; and disclosed protected health information (PHI) to third party vendors without a written business associate agreement.

“People need to trust that their private health information will remain exactly that; private,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “It’s not just my hope that covered entities will learn from this example and proactively find and address their security risks, it’s what the law requires.”

In addition to a $2.3 million monetary settlement, a corrective action plan requires 21CO to complete a risk analysis and risk management plan, revise policies and procedures, educate its workforce on policies and procedures, provide all maintained business associate agreements to OCR, and submit an internal monitoring plan.

On May 25, 2017, 21CO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The settlement with OCR will resolve OCR’s claims against 21CO and the corrective action plan will ensure that the reorganized entity emerges from bankruptcy with a strong HIPAA compliance program in place. The settlement with OCR was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on December 11, 2017.

"Advocate Health Care Network (Advocate) has agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), for multiple potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) involving electronic protected health information (ePHI). Advocate has agreed to pay a settlement amount of $5.55 million and adopt a corrective action plan.  This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance (dating back to the inception of the Security Rule in some instances), the involvement of the State Attorney General in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country. 
“We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals’ ePHI is secure,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.”
OCR began its investigation in 2013, when Advocate submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate and distinct incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group (""AMG""). The combined breaches affected the ePHI of approximately 4 million individuals.  The ePHI included demographic information, clinical information, health insurance information, patient names, addresses, credit card numbers and their expiration dates, and dates of birth.

•obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession; and
•reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
